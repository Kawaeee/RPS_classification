# RPS_classification
  * This project was previously a part of CSC340 Artificial Intelligence class.

  * We used Keras framework with GPU to develop our model using Google Colaboratory.

## Datasets
* RPS dataset was acquired from [Rock Scissor Paper](https://www.kaggle.com/alishmanandhar/rock-scissor-paper)

  * After that, we shuffle the dataset and randomly split using 80:10:10 ratios with [dataset-split](https://github.com/muriloxyz/dataset-split)
